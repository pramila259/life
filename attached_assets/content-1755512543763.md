# Importance of Certification

A GIE Certificate provides clear details of the item that accompanies it, giving confidence to both the buyer and the seller. A stone´s value is determined by its gemmological makeup, its natural rarity, and its finished quality. Diamonds and gemstones that may look similar, can have important differences in value. Even experts need to use powerful analytic tools to be able to detect synthetics, treatments and enhancement processes. GIE lead the way in understanding and recognising these key differences, using the very finest equipment to guarantee accuracy.

GIE is the trusted name for both expert and impartial grading of diamonds, gemstones and also jewellery.

It is our key belief that a gemstone should only ever change hands when accompanied by a certificate that attests to its quality. GIE is accepted as the common language of confidence and trust in the Gemological world, and should be considered an essential part of any purchase. Impartial and accurate grading is our first priority, and we take this responsibility very seriously.
